### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learned how to use ::after ::before Pseudo-elements.

```html
<h1>HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div>Div❤️</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to refine my knowledgment in JavaScript.
